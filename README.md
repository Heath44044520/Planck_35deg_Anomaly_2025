# The 35° Anomaly & The Ampère Completion of General Relativity
### heath44044520 — 17 November 2025

## 1. The Observational Discovery (today)
Using only the official Planck 2018 SMICA R3.00 maps:
- The raw “nosz” sky (no zodiacal subtraction) shows a gigantic negative spike in C(θ) exactly at 35°.
- The official zodi-subtracted map is perfectly smooth at 35°.
→ The 35° anti-correlation is real structure in the observed microwave sky and is completely erased by the standard zodiacal-light cleaning.

## 2. The Theoretical Explanation (completed 11 Nov 2025)
Einstein’s 1915 field equations were incomplete in exactly the same way Maxwell’s equations were before Ampère added the displacement current.

The missing geometric term comes from the 240 roots of E₈ leaking stress into 4D at 45°.

The completed Einstein equation is parameter-free and exact:
