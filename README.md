# Planck 35° Anomaly + GEOMTRIC E8 Projection
Heath Stamper – 24 November 2025

Two independent results from the same researcher, same month:

1. **Observational result**  
   A real, reproducible, mask-dependent difference in large-angle correlations  
   between the three raw (nosz) Planck 2018 maps and the official zodi-subtracted products.  
   → See 4-page paper + measured plot

2. **Geometric signal**  
   The 240 roots of E8, stereographically projected onto the CMB sky,  
   cluster strikingly around a 35° ring from the south ecliptic pole —  
   the same angular scale found in the observational analysis.

No claim is made that one causes the other.  
Only that both exist in the same sky, at the same angle, in the same month.

The universe is trying to tell us something.
